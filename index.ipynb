    "\n",
    "A one-sample z test is the most basic type of hypothesis test and is performed where the population means and standard deviation are known. This makes the analysis very simple. The main takeaway from this lesson and accompanied lab is to have an idea around the process of hypothesis testing and understanding test statistics and p-values. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and explain use cases for a 1-sample z-test\n",
    "* Set up null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "* Calculate z statistic using z-tables and cdf functions\n",
    "* Calculate and interpret p-value for significance of results"

    "\n",
    ">The 1-sample z-test is best suited for situations where we we want to investigate whether a given \"sample\" comes from a particular \"population\". \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you are doing an investigation on the data collected from successive cohorts of students taking the data science classes. You may want to ask yourself whether a particular sample of students is similar to or different from student population in general in terms of any of its attributes (age, performance, marital/social status etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "In situations like one above, a 1-sample Z test is used only for testing of the sample mean. Following this notion, our hypothesis would test whether the average of our sample students suggests that this sample comes from a population with a know mean or whether it comes from a different population. Examples of when we would likely know the population standard deviation are for things like IQ scores, SAT or ACT scores (those standardized college entrance exams) and heights and weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's set up a problem scenario (known as a research question or analytical question) and apply a 1-sample z-test, while explaining all the steps required to call our results \"statistically significant\"."

He wants to know as a baseline what the average intelligence of his students were relative to the general population. He used a standardized IQ test which has a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 16. The 50 students in his study scored an average of 102 on the IQ test. At He wants to investigate the fact whether the increase is IQ for the sample students is due to mentoring. "

    "So now that we have our hypotheses is in place, what we want to do is REJECT our null hypothesis, instead of trying to prove our alternative hypothesis. Thats the way significance testing works. It takes a lot more to actually prove your intuition as a \"scientific theory\". By rejecting the null hypothesis, you can confidently say that your results are significant. And for this, you need to set a significance level (called alpha)\n",

    "Yes, it takes some getting used to come in terms with this. Putting it simply, the significance level is the probability that you find \"false evidence\".\n",
    "\n",

So later we'll see that if our results follow this pattern, we will be able to say that \"With a confidence level of 95%, we can state that ....\". For a z-distribution, this can be shown as below:\n",
